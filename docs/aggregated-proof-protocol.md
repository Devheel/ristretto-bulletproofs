The `aggregated_range_proof` module contains an API for producing a proof that multiple integer values are within a certain range.

Aggregated proof protocol
=========================

This is a documentation for the internal implementation of an aggregated range proof. You may find the introduction to all the pieces of the protocol, including how the aggregated range proof math works, in the [notes](../notes/index.html) module, and an introduction to the implementation of the single-value range proof in the [range proof module](../range_proof/index.html).
